======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

+ a couple of places where your indenting isn't consistent
+ the append() should increase the list size by STARTING_SIZE
    not by one
+ nice idea to use INT_ARRAY_VALUE as a flag value
+ I think holefiller() may be going a bit too far back
+ you could have added a few more tests, but who's counting...
